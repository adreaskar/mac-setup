## Homebrew

First step is to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Open terminal and paste the command:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
This will also install the `xcode build tools` which is needed by other developer tools.

## iTerm2

Next, install `iTerm2` using brew in the built in terminal like so:
```
brew install iterm2
```
Once installed, open settings using `cmd + ,`:
1. Appearance -> Theme -> Minimal
2. Profiles -> Default
